When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you want to keep your work safe or when you want to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

    Changes make in one commit may break functionality of the program and I might want to have 
    only working version available for public access
