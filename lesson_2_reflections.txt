What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	There is created empty repository. It is required to create initial structure which 
	will be tracking added files. This repository is tied to directoy in which it was created.

How is the staging area differentfrom the working directory and the repository? What value do youthink it offers?

	Staging area contains snapshot of files from the working directory at the time we added them
	to this area. They are not in repository yet. Before commiting staging area we can change files
	or replace them with updated versions.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    After modifications done I can add one modified file to staging area and commit. Next I can
    add another file and so on. At any time I can make sure using git diff --staged that changes
    between staging area and last commit are related to one logical change.
